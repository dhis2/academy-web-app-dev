## Morning workshop 2 (API Routes)

## Common Closing session

Will be an interactive session where the following topics will be discussed.

### How to keep learning
Now that the basics are covered, how do you keep learning? We’re going to be looking at where documentation is hosted, and how to learn from other people’s code (GitHub) among other things. Developer Portal will be discussed during this presentation as well.


#### CoP, JIRA & Getting help

How can the Community of Practice play a role in learning more and getting answers to questions anyone might encounter during their continued development? We’ll be diving into the CoP and seeing what categories are available, where they should post what kind of questions, and how to tag their posts. 

Furthermore, of course, also looking into searching for answers, answering other’s questions and more.

Then there’s the upstream direction of asking questions and reporting bugs when issues are encountered. Through a contact known in the organization you’re working for, or through JIRA.

#### Developer Meetups
We’ll shortly discuss developer meetups, what kind of topics have been present in 2023/early 2024, and what to expect going forward. But also asking for volunteers to have an Academy-themed meetup where several people will share their experience during the academy for 10-15 minutes (short time each).
